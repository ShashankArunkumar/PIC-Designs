I am adding all the files where I build componants using the GDS factory library (9.5.10) as a part of my M1 internship in CEA and Instutut Neel (CNRS). 
These are codes to build different PIC that are used as test circuits for the propagation loss characterisation of th waveguide. 
In addition to the Codes for GDS file creation. I will also add codes that I wrote for specific parameter sweep and optimization simulation. I will use Tidy 3D and lumerical for this!
I will also add the NPF files and Job files that can be used using the Nanobeam platform to perform E beam patterning. 
I will try to explain the conversion from GDS  E beam files and the logic behind the different exposure steps to the best of my understanding. 
This Repository is intended to serve as a guide for students that are getting started with PIC design, E beam patterning and clean room fabrication of the designs. 
The hope is that Reviewing this project will help students understand the various steps including, Design, Optimization simulatiom, E beam patterning, Clean room fabrication, anf finally 2D and 3D simulation that are necessary in characterizing a PIC.
In addition to this you can also read the paper that I will publish with the results and interpretation to understand how the results could be presented.
